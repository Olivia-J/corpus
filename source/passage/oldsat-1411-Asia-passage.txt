Many crossword puzzle devotees regard the wildly popular number game Sudoku with the disdain a jazz purist might have for a sellout pop star. For crossword constructors, Sudoku represents a robotic outsourcing of the puzzle trade. Sudoku requires no individual artistry, no exquisite handcrafting; the puzzles are simply cranked out by computers. One crossword enthusiast suspects the upstart competition has piqued many crossword fans.
"People are only going m spend so much time a day on a puzzle, and it's either going to be a number puzzle or a crossword, right?" he says. "A lot of crossword enthusiasts don't want to hear that, but it's the truth."
Around 320 B.c. the ancient Greek geographer Pytheas made a remarkable sea journey around the distant Atlantic fringe of northern Europe. Afterward, some of his contemporaries regarded him as a brilliant scientist; others, as an outright liar. Scholars who have more recently examined the evidence compare him to explorers like Captain Cook and Columbus. Few now doubt the truth of his claims to have journeyed to the very limits of the ancient European world, but how he traveled, where exactly he went, and what he saw are Issues still as shrouded in mystery as the frightening North Atlantic shore was in the minds of his fellow Greeks.
This passage was adapted from a 2009 novella set in Egypt.
Ever since he was a child, he'd loved to draw--people's faces, trees, the ears in the streets. Everything his eyes saw was imprinted in detail on his young mind. Then the lines he made would run over the paper to reshape things into the way he wanted to see them. Every morning, he'd take his coloring pencils and a sketchbook and go to the municipal garden in Zaqaziq, isolate himself on an empty seat, and draw. When he was twenty, he left Zaqaziq, where he had been born, to live in a small room on the roof of an old house in the Bein el-Sarayat neighborhood of Cairo. Before two years had passed, he was drawing the main cartoon for three weekly magazines, and at age twenty-four he put on his first exhibition of oil paintings.
These beginnings were worthy, no doubt, of Ragheb, Bikar*, or any other great painter, but I'm not talking about any of them. These were the beginnings of Abd el-Ati, and who has heard of him? Abd el-Ati was my father, and, despite the exciting, promise-packed start, he ended up far from what was expected. Abd el-Ati did not shine and his great hopes as a painter were never realized. He changed nothing in the development of painting, as he had dreamed of doing, and thirty years after his move to Cairo, my father was still an obscure artist earning his living doing drawings for a magazine called Life that nobody read and getting by on other small jobs, such as giving private art lessons to the children of the rich. This was where Abd el-Ati was at , and I ask myself, why? Was he lacking in talent? For sure he had more than many painters who succeeded and became famous. Was it laziness and love of pleasure that did him in? On the contrary, my father led a dissolute life only during his last years. ]Before then, he used to produce prolifically and persistently and when I was little Fd often wake in the morning to find he hadn't slept but spent the entire night on a new painting. I loved him then. His eyes would be exhausted, his face drawn, and his laugh low and satisfied. He'd dry his hands quickly on his paint-spattered smock and bend down to kiss me and his good, coarse smell would take possession of me. Then he'd take me by the hand, pull me back a little, point to the painting on its easel, and ask me, pretending to be very grave, “What think you, my dear sir, of the work? Do you like it?" My mother would protest laughingly and say, "You're asking Isam? What can the child know about painting?" And my father would reply, picking me up in his arms and kissing me, "What do you mean? He will be a great artist. One day I'll tell you, 'I told you so!'"
If it wasn’t laziness or lack of talent, then what was it? When I got older, I work for reason. What my father lacked was charisma—that halo that encircles great men and grants them influence over others.
On the first of my long lonely excursions, botanizing in glorious freedom around the forests and swamps surrounding the Great Lakes, I discovered the rarest and e most beautiful of the flowering plants--Calypso borealis (the Hider of the North). I had been fording streams more and more difficult to cross and wading bogs and swamps that seemed more and more extensive and more difficult to force one's way through. Entering one of these great tamarac and arbor-vitae swamps one morning, struggling through tangled drooping branches and over and under broad heaps of fallen trees, I began to fear that I would not be able to reach dry ground before dark and therefore would have to pass the night in the swamp, faint and hungry.
But when the sun was getting low and everything seamed most bewildering and discouraging, I found beautiful Calypso on the mossy bank of a stream, growing not in the ground but on a bed of yellow mosses in which its small white bulb had found a soft nest and from which its one leaf and one flower sprung, The flower was white and made the impression of the utmost simple purity like a snowflower. No other bloom was near it, for the bog a short distance below the surface was still frozen, and the water was ice cold. It seemed the most spiritual of all the flower people I had ever met. I sat down beside it and fairly cried for joy.
It seems wonderful that so flail and lowly a plant has such power over human hearts. This Calypso meeting happened some forty-five years ago, and it was more memorable and impressive than virtually any of my meetings with human beings.
How long I sat beside Calypso I don't know. Hunger and weariness vanished, and only after the sun was low in the west I plashed on through the swamp, strong and exhilarated as if never more to feel any mortal care.

I'm sitting on a rock m the Big Blackfoot River in western Montana. The sun is glistening off the water, and the grasses on the banks are ablaze in their fall glory.
The air is crisp and silent, and I'm utterly alone but for the hawk gliding by above and the trout lurking in the water below. This is the spot where Norman Maclean set his novel A River Runs Through It, and I’m sitting here waiting for one of those perfect moments when time stops and I feel myself achieving a mystical communion with nature.
But nothing's happening. I've been hanging around this magnificent setting for 30 minutes and I haven't had one moment of elevated consciousness. The ageless rhythms of creation are happening all around me. The crisp air whispers. The branches sway. If John Muir were here, he'd probably be in rapture, writhing on the ground in ecstasy over the beauty of some nearby twig. But as for me, not a thing. It's October, and it occurs to me that maybe it's too late in the season for transcendence.
"Eventually, all things merge into one, and a fiver runs through it," Maclean writes. When I read that back in my living room n few months ago, it scorned so profound. Now I can't figure out what the hack it means. The only things merging into one are my fingers into a block of frozen flesh. And instead of making me profound, this solitude is just giving me the creeps. There probably isn't another human being within ten miles of here. When I think of the calamities that could befall a person out here, I realize that there are advantages to seeking inner peace at spots close to a pay phone and an emergency rescue squad. Every twig snap begins to sound like the first hint of an onrushing grizzly. I look at my watch and realize that I had better start feeling serene oneness with the natural world pretty soon.
I've get dinner reservations back in Missoula at six.

Morning people, cheerfully referred to as early birds,
set the attitudinal tone of the entire culture. They've
decided that morning is the best time of the day, and that
night owls (people who are not naturally bright eyed and
bushy tailed at the very crack of dawn) are in some way
lazy and unfocused. In my view, morning is not the best
time of day. It's a free time of day, of course, but it isn't
inherently better than any other time. Getting up early
does not necessarily mean you're more productive or a
better member of society. I tried living on my husband's
schedule, and all I did was sleep through my most
productive hours.
physiological factor that may underline our early bird
and night owl behaviors is the circadian rhythm of body
temperature. Both early: birds and night owls experience
a body temperature high and low every 24 hours. However,
early birds achieve their peak.temperature earlier in the day
than night owls do. Given that we are active, and alert when
our body temperature is highest, one can understand why
early birds are more alert and active early in the day, while
night owls do not become entirely alert and active until
later.

The following passage is from an essay examining the
work of Dorothea Lange and other photographers
employed by the Farm Security Administration (FSA), a
government agency created to assist farmers during the
Great Depression.
The photographers' assignment was to document the
need for FSA programs, and Lange enthusiastically
accepted the task. Such was her admiration for FDR and
the New Deal1 that she had no problem with serving up to
the government what it ordered. At first, she dutifully
"documented" migratory workers' camps, alternatively
mired in mud or layered with dust; she pictured filthy water
supplies and children covered with flies. But she soon drew
upon her area of greatest mastery: always a portrait
photographer, Lange turned toward the poor the same eye
she had previously directed toward the rich. She made
portraits of farmworkers within the same visual
conventions she used in her studio, but the change in
subject matter made them, at that time, unconventional,
startling, gripping. Other FSA photographers were
influenced by her, and a new style was being pioneered
by the most unexpected of style makers, the federal
government. And she was comfortable with her job
description: to bring rural Depression conditions to public
attention and to do it in a manner that showed its victims as
citizens, worthy of help and able to make use of it.

That job description raises the question, what is
documentary photography? The term was new in the 1930s,
and even the concept was familiar only within a small
network of social reformers. European modem
photographers began to speak of photographic "documents"
as early as 1910, defining their work against the romantic,
fuzzy photography called "pictorialist" that then prevailed.
In the United States, Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine pioneered
a photography that showed the wretched conditions of poor
and working-class-people in order to gather support for
progressive social reform. American documentary was
never neutral or apolitical, but an exhortation to action. At
the same time.some photographers promoted a mystique
that documentary photography was merely an "objective"
recording of"reality." Walker Evans, Lange's colleague at
the FSA, considered it "a stark record... [of] actuality
untouched .... "A document was supposed to be
disinterested, as if it were possible for human beings to
make images without point of view. Lange frequently
contradicted herself regarding the documentary. Carping
with her friend photographer Minor White, she wrote,
"I object to this misconception and am surprised that you
too repeat it. Documentary photographers are not social
workers. Social reform is not the object of documentary
photography. It may be a consequence because it can reveal
situations and can be concerned with change. Its power lies
in the evidence it presents not in the photographer's
conclusion for he is a witness to the situation not a
propagandist or an advertiser. A documentary photography
has a responsibility of keeping the record and to keep it
superbly well." But Lange also acknowledged being a
propagandist: "Everything is propaganda for what you
believe in, actually, isn't it?... I don't see that it could be
otherwise. The harder and the more deeply you believe in
anything, the more in a sense you're a propagandist.
Conviction, propaganda, faith, t don't know, I never have
been able to come to the conclusion that that's a bad word."
The tension in documentary photography between
telling the "objective" truth and arguing a point of view
continues when you consider photographic technique.
Professional photographers don't "take" pictures but make
them. Every camera adjustment—speed, aperture, filter,
frame, depth of focus, angle of vision, etc, -- shapes the
outcome, as do the myriad manipulations made in the
darkroom in developing and printing.
The only resolution of this tension must be approximate.
Same forms of manipulation, as when Soviet publishers
removed Trotsky from earlier pictures in which he had
stood next to Lenin, produce direct lies.2 But we should
never treat a photograph as something free of human
perspective—nor would that be desirable. Lange's
photographic work was saturated with conviction.

This passage has been adapted from a 2004 book that
examines the functions of the brain.
One fall morning when I was six, I hurried through
an orchard with three schoolmates. We were late for first
grade, and there were going to be silhouette drawings none
of us wanted to miss. I remember the shiny plaid dress
that Susan Green wore, her matching hair ribbon, and
a petticoat that rustled as she moved. Ripening apples
spiced the air with scent. High in the branches, dark plums
huddled like bats. Susan dragged my arm because I'd
slowed to stare at the plums, her eyes following mine, and
when she demanded to know what I was looking at, I told
her. Suddenly she let go of my arm and all three girls
recoiled. The possibility of bats didn't frighten them. I
frightened them. I looked at plums and saw bats. The alarm
on their faces became an indelible memory, one colored by
shame, and fused with a nearly levitating sense of wonder.
That vignette holds the kernel of many truths about
memory. To remember, the brain does four things superbly:
recognizes patterns, interprets them, records their source,
and retrieves them. In the orchard, I saw apples, smelled
their corklike sweetness, heard the warble of children, held
unforeseen feelings. At the time, brain receptors combined
all the stimuli fast, busily interpreting what an orchard
meant, the unique scent of apples, the similar architecture
of plums and huddled bats, and noting the whereabouts
as a walk to school, while emotions piled up.
Now, half a lifetime later, only shards of that orchard
memory float into my ken---light swerving off a satin skirt,
clouds caged in the branches of a tree, the hug of an elastic
waistband on corduroy pants I wore under my dress, the
scratchy whispers of Susan's starched petticoat. But I can
forcibly capture others. Not the other girls' names, nor the
cadence of their voices, Lots of details have faded through
the normal vanishing and crumbling known as "graceful
degradation." Like an old photograph, my recall of that day
has lost some of its color and clarity with passing years.
Memories nest in elaborate thickets of association.
If I concentrate hard and insinuate myself back into that
moment, into that body, peering out behind curly bangs,
I can feel the swing of my ponytail, and my body flushed
with wonder the way a sugar cube absorbs water. My
memory caroms off another association. The sort of sugar
cubes a stable-hand placed onto my trembling palm one
summer, and a horse gummed off gently with velvety lips
that tickled. If I'd been bitten by that horse, the event
would have burrowed deep into my memory and advised
my reflexes as well as my conscious mind. Indeed, pain and
memory are closely linked. Pain is like a bad memory that
won't fade, which makes good survival sense. It's not
enough to identify danger, an organism also has to
remember its features. Under general anesthesia, one may
not be aware of pain, but the nervous system remembers
it well. Some researchers have been administering
"preemptive analgesia," pain medicine beforehand, not just
during or after an operation. Hoping to keep chronic pain
memories from forming in the first place, they block the
nerve pathways leading from the injury site to the spinal
cord. Thus far, it's working well in some operations.
Back to the orchard. The long sung of facts about
apples, horses, orchards, and such involves semantic
memory. Remembering that specific morning and those
girls--on a day when the plums caught my eye, the clouds
seemed caged by the branches, and I felt both shame and
wonder--involves episodic memory. Combine the two and
you get declarative memory, a declaration of events easy to
slap a word on, the explicit truths. Somehow, all these ways
of remembering combine and we feel singular. Add enough
pieces to the mosaic and an individual finds shape. We take
for granted these dazzling skills, and the most treasured
gift of all, being able to time-travel and explore the lost
kingdoms of yesterday. We may be the only animals with
this rich form of episodic memory, in which we can revive
our past, play it back like a film we stop to look at, enter
imaginatively, and revise as we grow older.
