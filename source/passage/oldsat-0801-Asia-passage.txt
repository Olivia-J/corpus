This all started on a Saturday morning in May, one of those warm spring days that smell like clean linen.
Delia had gone to the supermarket to shop for the week' s meals. She was standing in the produce section, languidly choosing a bunch of celery. Grocery stores always made her reflective. Why was it, she was wondering, that celery was not called "corduroy plant"? That would be much more colorful. And garlic bulbs should be "moneybags," because their shape reminded her of the sacks of gold coins in folktales.

Beginning in the 1780's, novelist Charlotte Smith's explicit and implicit criticism of English life and laws, of England's social organization, earned her a reputation as a "subversive." Her novels contain some of the earliest literary attacks on the English legal system. In comparison to later expos6s by nineteenth-century novelists such as Charles Dickens, Charlotte Smith's attacks appear somewhat timorous. However, it cannot be denied that it was Smith who introduced such a target for later novelists and that when she did, her action was considered so audacious that it laid her open to the charge of being a "menace."


This passage is excerpted from a novel first published in 1882 Here, the narrator is describing his friend, a private detective renowned for his brilliance and eccentricity .
His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge.
Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle,* he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a Climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the solar system. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth traveled round the sun appeared to me to be such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.
"You appear to be astonished," he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. "Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it."
"To forget it!”
"You see," he explained, "I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with Such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent: Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that yon knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones."
"But the solar system!" I protested.
"What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently.
"You say that we go-round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work."

The following passage was adapted from a book published in 2000.
It was so rare to see a real Asian American on television when I was a kid that we had a family ritual when one was spotted. It constituted what I now call an "Asian sighting." A hoot went out: "Hey, come see this, look now!" Real Asians didn't include Hop Sing, the Cartwright family's houseman on the TV show Bonanza, or David Carradine, Jerry Lewis, or the numerous other white actors who donned makeup to play Asians. We only shouted when we saw regular Asian Americans like us, on the news, game shows, variety programs, or beauty pageants. It was a rare event.
We would then drop everything and make a frenzied rush to the tube to see who had entered that mysterious TV land where people of Asian descent were virtually nonexistent. My parents participated enthusiastically in the routine as well. They liked to assess for us kids the looks, ethnicity, demeanor, intelligence and other vital signs of the real Asian, a commentary they delivered in a manner as succinct and passionate as that of a sports announcer. Most irksome was their habit of comparing us to the TV Asian. When an Asian beauty contestant competed for Miss World or Miss Universe, my father invariably turned to me and said, in all seriousness, "Helen, why don't you try for Miss World?" My brothers snickered and taunted in the background while I seethed in embarrassed fury.
One day I became one of those real Asians on TV.
In 1972, I visited China as one of the first Americans to get into the country after President Nixon's historic visit. The TV game show To Tell the Truth asked me to be a contestant on the show, which had celebrities guess the real contestant from imposters after receiving clues about the real person. The show would cover my train fare to New York from New Jersey. I wouldn't get paid, but for every celebrity panelist who guessed wrong, I'd win $50.00, That was enough to entice me, the struggling student, and I hopped the train to New York. On the set, I met the two Asian American actors hired to play me: not only were they older than I, they were Miss World material. The available selection of Asian American actors must have been as sparse as the roles available for them to play. When it came time to pick the real Asian American college student who went to China, somehow all the panelists picked me.
On the scheduled air date, my whole family crowded around the television. Morn and Dad held back from doing their usual critique. At first we all watched in stunned silence, to see me as the Asian sighting. In those pre-videocassette recorder days. it was startling to see yourself on screen. My three older brothers made wisecracks and my little sister and brother jumped up and down in excitement. Finally Dad said, "Your voice sounds different." Mom said I should have worn more makeup. They stopped foisting the Miss World pageant on me. So much for my television career. Most mind-boggling was the thought that my brief, shining moment on To Tell the Truth was an Asian sighting for other Asian American families across America.
Asian sightings are more common now, but they are still infrequent enough to create a thrill whenever real Asians appear on the screen, as martial artists, for example, or television reporters. We cheer to see a Chinese man, chubby and middle-aged, as the star of a television series.
We heave a sigh of relief when a movie like Mulan is released, using real Asian American actors' voices. Each Asian sighting that breaks through the constricting stereotypes gives another reason to celebrate.

Passage 1
Because chimpanzees exhibit behavior so remarkably similar to some human behavior, scientists observing them in the wild often develop a degree of empathy with the individuals being studied. In itself this is not a bad thing. Subtle communication cues among chimpanzees are more readily detected and recorded once an observer has established this empathy.
However, scientists must guard against the constant "danger of automatically interpreting what they see as if chimps act from human motivations. Their observations must be as objective as possible. Intuitive interpretations 'may initially be based on an understanding stemming directly from empathy, but they must be tested afterward against the facts set out in the data.
Passage 2
My first day observing a community" of forest chimpanzees showed me a richer and more satisfying world than I had imagined. I suddenly recognized why I, a nonscientist, or anyone should care about what happens to them: not, ultimately, because they use tools and solve problems and are intellectual beings, but because they are emotional beings, as we are, and because their emotions are so obviously similar to ours.
I was moved by the play, the adult male chasing a toddler round and round a tree, the mother nibbling her baby's toes and looking blissful, the three females playing with and adoring a single infant. They feel that was my discovery.

Questions 13-24 are based on the following passage.
This passage, adapted from a 1998 book, discusses the ability of some sea creatures to emit light, a phenomenon known as bioluminescence.
Sailing at night in luminescent seas is something splendid that is not given to everyone. On a quiet night, with just enough wind to ghost along without the engine, it can be euphoric. Euphoria is worth seeking; we don't often achieve it in this rush-around world. You need a pause, or you miss it. Sitting in the cockpit on a night ,watch, it takes a little time to become adapted to the dark and to realize how much is going on in the sea around you.
What you generally see first is a cloudy luminescence.
One source of such luminescence is an alga* called Noctiluca. Each of these organisms' is barely a millimeter across and practically transparent, so that it is difficult to see even if you know what you are looking for. It is not much to look at if you haven't got a microscope aboard, but a more interesting question is not what Noctiluca looks like, flashing or quiescent, but why it bothers te flash. Isn't it suicidal to advertise your presence in this blatant way, when you are near enough invisible if you sit tight and do nothing? The answer, for the alga, is copepods, the next step up in the food chain and the most abundant small predators in the sea. Crustaceans, copepods are related to shrimps, crabs, and lobsters. But they are only three or four millimeters long--big enough to see in a bucket, if you shine a bright light and watch for their shadows, for they, too, do their best to be transparent.
Copepods move in jerks, pouncing on yet smaller prey.
They don't like prey that flashes. Grab it, it explodes into light in their scratchy little arms, and they drop it.
An odd bit of behavior, really, because the alga, so far as We know, doesn't taste nasty, or sting, or do anything unpleasant to the predator, and you might reasonably expect the copepod to habituate tO the flashes after a few tries. But it does not, apparently, and since practically every animal that has ever been studied habituates to stimuli that repeatedly prove harmless, there must be some other explanation. The most likely possibility is that the copepod itself wishes to remain invisible. Chomp down the alga, and the unfortunate copepod would be, for a while, lit up by the glow in its gut, a sitting target for a fish or anyone else with a taste for seafood.
In some of the larger luminescent species, in which the patterns of light differ between sexes, it is a fair bet that luminescence serves as an identification signal, a means of bringing the sexes together in places that have so little light that shapes and normal, reflected

colors won't do. Others use lights to attract prey, like deep-sea anglerfish, with luminous-tipped rods that wave seductively in front of cavernous mouths, invisible in the abyssal dark. Or searchlights. One outstandingly devious group of deep-sea predatory fish, Malacosteus, has developed a system of red searchlights that are probably invisible to everybody except themselves. Red light hardly penetrates beyond the first few meters of water, even at the sea surface, and most mid-to-deep-water marine animals have visual systems that cannot perceive red light. Malacosteus, one must suppose, has the jump on almost everybody around: night sights to target prey that will never even be aware that they have been spotted.
But by far the most widespread use is camouflage. Deep down, or even in shallow water at night, an animal is often invisible except as a silhouette against the feeble light filtering from above. A predator can come up from below, itself invisible to a victim~m the water above it. Lights along the underside, carefully matched to the light coming from above, can destroy the silhouette. In principle, the system would work in broad daylight. Indeed, a system like this was used briefly at the beginning of the Second World War, to hide military aircraft hunting submarines.
It reduced the range at which planes could be spotted from a dozen miles to around two, uncomfortably close for a submarine recharging its batteries at the surface and needing time to crash dive. But then radar became commonplace, and lights became obsolete.


The following passages address the issue of accuracy in the translation of poetry." Passage I discusses epic poems composed in ancient Greek and attributed to Homer. Passage 2 considers a tenth-century poem written in Anglo-Saxon, an early form of English.

In the mid-nineteenth century, a scholar named Francis William Newman attempted a literal translation of the works of Homer. His purpose was to publish a translation that would contrast with the elegance of Alexander Pope's eighteenth-century translation. Newman's book would be forgotten today had it not been reviewed by Matthew Arnold, one of the nineteenth century’s most famous essayists and poets.
Newman supposed that a literal translation must be the most faithful translation. Arnold, however, argued that in Homer's works, several qualities were to be found clarity, nobility, simplicity, and so on. He thought that a translator should always convey the impression of those qualities, even in cases where the original text did not bear them out. Arnold pointed out that a literal translation made for oddity and for uncouthness.
For example, in the Romance languages we do not say "It is cold" to describe a winter's day--we say "It makes cold": Il fait froid in French, Fa freddo in Italian, and so on. Yet I don't think anybody should translate "I1 fait froid" as "It makes cold."
Matthew Arnold pointed out that if a text is translated literally, then false emphases, are created. I do not know whether he came across Captain Burton’s translations of a classic Arabic language book during the same time period. Perhaps he did, but too late to refer to it in his remarks about translation. Burton translates the title Quitah alif laila wa laila as Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, instead of Book of the Thousand and One Nights. This translation is a literal one. Yet it  is false in the sense that the words "book of the thousand nights and a night" are a common form in Arabic, while in English we have a slight shock of surprise. And this, of course, had not been intended by the original.
Nowadays, a hundred years after Matthew Arnold, we are fond of literal translation; in fact, many of us accept only literal translations because we want to give the original authors their due. That attitude would have seemed a crime to European translators in ages past. They were

thinking of something far worthier than the individual person. They wanted to prove that the vernacular, the language of their contemporaries, was as capable of a great poem as the ancient language in which the original poem was composed. I don't think any contemporary of Alexander Pope thought about Homer and Pope. I suppose that the readers, the best readers anyhow, thought of the poem itself. They were interested in Homer's two great epic poems, and they had no care for verbal trifles.
All throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, people thought of translation not in terms of a literal rendering but in terms of something being re-created. They thought of translators as having read a work anti then somehow evolving that work from themselves, from their own might, from the known possibilities of their own languages.
Passage 2
"The Seafarer," translated in 1911 by Ezra Pound, shows Pound's method of translating which, when he is so inclined, produces not so much a translation as a new poem in the spirit of the original. In translating "The Seafarer" Pound aims to reproduce the "feel" of the original by reproducing Anglo-Saxon sounds, whether or not the modern words correspond literally to the meaning of the original words.
This way of translating offended scholars who believed that translation must be literal to be accurate. Pound provoked their Wrath by stating in print that his version of "The Seafarer" was "as nearly literal" as any translation could be. Obviously it is not. Where the Anglo-Saxon has wrecan ("to make, compose"), Pound has "reckon." Where the Anglo-Saxon has sumeres weard ("guardian of summer"), Pound has "summerward." And so on.
Moreover, there are unfortunately some mistakes, as when Pound misreads purh ("through") as pruh ("coffin").
Nevertheless, Pound's translation conveys the important meaning of the Anglo-Saxon poem and does something that a literal translation fails to do renders it into poetic English, finding new equivalents for old emotions. This was Pound's contribution as a translator--he showed that to translate accurately you must do more than find words that have the same meaning as words in another language.
Literal translation sounds like no language at all. The aim of translation is to find words that bring over the sense and spirit of the original So that they are understood. Therefore the translator must aim at making an "equation" rather than a literal translation.
